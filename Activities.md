Pair up with a neighbor and discuss:

* What was a challenging question you managed to solve. How did you collect the missing pieces of the puzzle. What did you google, who did you ask?

  * `ROUND` question. Round to the nearest thousand. Look up the docs for `ROUND` 
  * `ROUND` `CONCATENATE`. Watched video included in sql-zoo. Walk through
  * `SELECT` with in `SELECT`. Had to found how to sort on the next question.
